# Lab1-Git-GitHub-ML

Hi, my name is Sukinah Alhumaidi.

I am a Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics student with a strong interest in technology, system security, and data-driven solutions. My academic background focuses on cybersecurity and digital forensics, and I am particularly interested in Machine Learning due to its growing importance in security analytics, threat detection, and intelligent decision-making systems.

Through this course, I aim to gain a solid understanding of Machine Learning fundamentals and learn how to manage ML projects effectively using Git and GitHub.

Looking forward to exploring Machine Learning applications and building practical skills throughout this course.
